# My Waybar Configuration
Waybar is kind of essential for most Hyprland setups in my opinion.
However I like mine to be very minimally configured.

From Left to Right
+ Arch Icon - This is a custom launcher that opens the Rofi Menu.
+ CPU - This shows me the current CPU Usage Percentage. Which is useful when monitoring compiling and workload.
+ Memory - This shows me the current Memory percentage that is allocated.
+ Tray - This is the equivalent of a system tray and usually only has the docker desktop and jetbrains toolbox icons in it.
+ Pulse Audio - This allows me to scroll over the icon and adjust my volume or the click it to toggle mute.
+ Time & Date
+ The Right Arrow - This is a custom menu that opens Rofi to provide options such as Lock Screen, Logout, Hibernate, Restart and Shutdown.
